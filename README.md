## Why not just Next.js? ##
According to a FAQ in the [Next.js Docs](https://github.com/zeit/next.js)

> **How do I fetch data?**
> 
> Itâ€™s up to you. getInitialProps is an async function (or a regular function that returns a Promise). It can retrieve data from anywhere.

and according to a the [Backpack docs](https://github.com/palmerhq/backpack)
> You should use create-react-app or Next.js for your frontend and then
> build your backend with Backpack.

The reason this combo is so great is because Next acts as the Page server and Backpack acts as an API server.  They both follow extremely similar ideologies.
